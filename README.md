#Udacity Project 3: Arcade Game Clone
Part of the Front-End Web Developer nanodegree from Udacity. The project utilizes concepts learned from [Object-Oriented JavaScript](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud015-nd) and [HTML5 Canvas](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud292-nd) courses.

##Purpose
I was provided with visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools I added a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate a challenging clone of the classic arcade game Frogger.

##Usage
Simply visit http://d3moid.github.io/udacity-frontend-p3-arcade-game/ to start playing!
